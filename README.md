**Tokyo Control Application**  

We introduce **Tokyo Control**, a companion application for the **Tokyo Fire Fighter Mobil**, a smart firefighting vehicle powered by **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology. This application enables remote control and real-time monitoring of the vehicle to ensure a rapid response in fire emergencies.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Manual Vehicle Control**: Move the vehicle forward, backward, left, or right through an intuitive user interface.  
- **Firebase Realtime Database Integration**: Facilitates real-time communication between the application and the ESP microcontroller for precise and responsive control.  
- **IoT Connectivity**: Seamless communication via **Wi-Fi** for remote control and monitoring.  

**Application Benefits:**  
The **Tokyo Control** application provides users with the flexibility to:  
1. Manually control the vehicle during emergencies.  
2. Ensure quick and efficient real-time operation.  

With this solution, we aim to deliver practical and innovative technology for firefighting, combining remote control and automation to enhance response speed and safety.
